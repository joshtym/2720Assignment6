PayStation Simulator
**********************************************************
Purpose of the program is simple enough. Simulate the paystation
using the code designed throughout the course of this semester.
The menu given when you launch the program is pretty simple and easy
to follow. Do note that when you switch between cities, your payments
will be automatically reset from the other ones, so think twice
about switching before you actually do. Unfortunately, I simply ran
out of time to do all the implementations, so this will have to suffice
and the decrement will be what it is. Once make is executed, you'll
find the interface executable in the simulationDir.
